        "   - Correlation Coefficient: **-0.0022**\n",
        "   - **Interpretation**: Suggests a negligible negative relationship. This means that there's hardly any discernible pattern in how changes in quantity affect the value.\n",

        "2. **Quantity vs. Weight**:\n",
        "   - Correlation Coefficient: **0.0028**\n",

        "3. **Value vs. Weight**:\n",
        "   - Correlation Coefficient: **-0.0078**\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. Further Analysis:\n",
        "- To gain deeper insights, it might be beneficial to:\n",
        "  - Explore **non-linear relationships**.\n",
        "  - Consider **additional variables** that could influence these relationships.\n"

        "\n",
        "3. **Potential Causes**:\n",
        "   - The dataset might be complex or noisy, making it challenging for a single Decision Tree to capture patterns.\n",
        "   - Features might not be strongly predictive of the target variable.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Ensemble Methods**:\n",
        "   - Use ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve classification performance and handle complexity better.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
        "   - Optimize the Decision Tree parameters (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per split) to potentially improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Analyze Dataset**:\n",
        "   - Examine the data distribution, feature importance, and potential outliers to identify factors contributing to low performance.\n"

        "## Analysis of Confusion Matrix for Decision Tree\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure of the Matrix:\n",
        "- **Rows** represent the actual class labels.\n",
        "- **Columns** represent the predicted class labels.\n",
        "- The diagonal elements represent correct classifications for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Observations:\n",
        "1. **Class 0**:\n",
        "   - **Correctly classified**: 153 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 1**: 171 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 2**: 185 instances\n",
        "   - The model struggles with Class 0, misclassifying the majority of instances into other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class 1**:\n",
        "   - **Correctly classified**: 170 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 0**: 159 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 2**: 160 instances\n",
        "   - Performance for Class 1 is slightly better than Class 0 but still poor, with significant misclassifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Class 2**:\n",
        "   - **Correctly classified**: 169 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 0**: 160 instances\n",
        "   - **Misclassified as Class 1**: 174 instances\n",
        "   - Similar performance as Class 1, with high misclassification rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Observations:\n",
        "- The model exhibits a **high level of confusion** between all three classes, with no class achieving high classification accuracy.\n",
        "- The **diagonal values (correct classifications)** are significantly outnumbered by the off-diagonal values (misclassifications), leading to low overall accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights:\n",
        "1. **Class Overlap**:\n",
        "   - The Decision Tree may not be effectively capturing the distinctions between the classes due to overlapping feature spaces or insufficient splitting criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Imbalance**:\n",
        "   - Misclassifications are relatively evenly distributed across classes, suggesting no significant class imbalance but a lack of separability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Limitations**:\n",
        "   - The simplicity of the Decision Tree algorithm might be contributing to its inability to model complex relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "1. **Advanced Models**:\n",
        "   - Consider ensemble methods like **Random Forests** or **Gradient Boosting** to improve performance by combining multiple weak learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - Perform detailed analysis to identify and create better features that improve class separability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, and splitting criteria to optimize performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
        "   - If the dataset has a high number of features, techniques like **PCA** or **t-SNE** could help reduce noise and improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
        "   - Explore techniques to enhance the dataset and better represent the true data distribution.\n",

        "   - Test different distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski) to better suit the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
        "   - Ensure features are appropriately scaled (e.g., via Min-Max scaling or Standardization), as KNN is sensitive to feature magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
        "   - Apply techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce noise and emphasize important features.\n",

        "1. **Low Accuracy**:\n",
        "   - The overall accuracy of 33% suggests the Logistic Regression model is not performing well on this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class Imbalance**:\n",
        "   - The model struggles with class imbalance, as indicated by the varying recall values across classes.\n",
        "   - **Class 2.0** shows a significantly higher recall compared to **Class 0.0**, which has a very low recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Linearity Assumption**:\n",
        "   - Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.\n",
        "   - If the relationship is non-linear, the model's performance might be limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Further Investigation**:\n",
        "   - Exploring alternative classification algorithms and feature engineering techniques is recommended to improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations:\n",
        "1. **Explore Other Models**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with algorithms like **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, or **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to improve classification performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - Create new features or transform existing ones to improve class separability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Address Class Imbalance**:\n",
        "   - Use techniques like **oversampling**, **undersampling**, or **cost-sensitive learning** to handle imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Regularization**:\n",
        "   - Apply regularization techniques like **L1** or **L2 regularization** to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluate Feature Importance**:\n",
        "   - Identify influential features and improve their representation or quality.\n",

        "1. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - Create additional features that capture patterns or trends in the data to improve class separability.\n",
        "   - Perform feature scaling or transformation (e.g., Standardization or Normalization) to enhance model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Address Class Imbalance**:\n",
        "   - Use techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**, undersampling, or class weights to reduce the impact of class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Try Non-linear Models**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with non-linear models such as **Random Forests**, **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**, or **Neural Networks** to capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
        "   - Perform grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Regularization**:\n",
        "   - Adjust regularization parameters (e.g., L1, L2) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Cross-validation**:\n",
        "   - Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation and prevent overfitting to specific subsets of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Visualize Features**:\n",
        "   - Analyze feature importance and their distributions to identify correlations and relationships between features and target classes.\n",

        "* Class 1.0: The model completely fails to predict this class, with 0 precision, recall, and F1-score. This is a major concern and indicates a significant weakness of the model for this specific class.\n",
        "* Class 2.0: The model has very low recall (0.05) for this class, meaning it misses most of the actual Class 2.0 instances. The precision is moderate (0.41), indicating that when it does predict Class 2.0, it's often correct. However, the overall performance for this class is poor.\n",
        "* Macro and Weighted Averages: The macro and weighted average scores are relatively low, reflecting the overall poor performance of the model, particularly for Class 1.0 and 2.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overall Interpretation:**\n",
        "* Model Limitations: The SGD model, with the current configuration and features, is not performing well in classifying the data, especially for Class 1.0 and 2.0. It seems to be biased towards Class 0.0, achieving high recall but low precision for that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Issues:**\n",
        "* The poor performance might be due to several factors:\n",
        "    * Class Imbalance: Class imbalance could be affecting the model's ability to learn patterns for the minority classes.\n",
        "    * Feature Relevance: The features used might not be informative enough to distinguish between the classes effectively.\n",
        "    * Model Complexity: The SGD model's complexity might need adjustment to avoid overfitting or underfitting.\n",
        "    * Learning Rate and Iterations: The learning rate and number of iterations used during training might need optimization."

        "* **Class 1.0:** The model struggles to predict Class 1.0 accurately. There are a high number of false negatives (174) and false positives (175 and 140 for Classes 0.0 and 2.0, respectively).\n",
